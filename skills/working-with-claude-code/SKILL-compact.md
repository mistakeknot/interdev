# Working with Claude Code (compact)

Reference library for Claude Code official documentation — plugins, hooks, MCP servers, skills, configuration, and integrations.

## When to Invoke

Creating/configuring plugins, MCP servers, hooks, or skills. Troubleshooting Claude Code. Setting up integrations (VS Code, JetBrains, CI/CD).

## Quick Lookup Table

| Task | Read |
|------|------|
| Create a plugin | `plugins.md` then `plugins-reference.md` |
| Set up MCP server | `mcp.md` |
| Configure hooks | `hooks.md` then `hooks-guide.md` |
| Write a skill | `skills.md` |
| CLI commands | `cli-reference.md` |
| Troubleshoot | `troubleshooting.md` |
| Configuration | `settings.md` |
| General setup | `setup.md` or `quickstart.md` |

## Workflow

1. Identify the relevant doc file from the table above
2. Read it from `references/` directory
3. Find the answer in official documentation
4. Apply the solution

For broad topics, start with the overview doc then drill into specifics. For uncertain topics, use Grep to search across `references/`.

## Key Docs (37 files in `references/`)

- **Core**: overview, quickstart, setup, settings, cli-reference, common-workflows
- **Extending**: plugins, plugins-reference, plugin-marketplaces, skills, mcp, hooks, hooks-guide, slash-commands, sub-agents

## Updating Docs

```bash
node ~/.claude/skills/working-with-claude-code/scripts/update_docs.js
```

Fetches latest from docs.claude.com. Run when docs seem outdated or new features are released.

## Key Rule

**Always consult official documentation before guessing** about config paths, API structures, hook names, or feature capabilities.
